## File download (via HTTP GET)
From nuget: **Pipaslot.Mediator.Http** since version **5.0.0**
In the previous versions, the mediator supported only HTTP POST requests. This was making file download complicated through HTML links/anchors.
Mediator exposes service `IMediatorUrlFormatter` to make the URL building as easy as possible. This service is registered by configuring client mediator via `services.AddMediatorClient()`. You only need to inject this service and pass the action instance to get a formatted URL.

```
@inject Pipaslot.Mediator.Http.IMediatorUrlFormatter _mediatorUrlFormatter
<a href="@_mediatorUrlFormatter.FormatHttpGet(new MyFileDownloadAction(FileId))">Download</a>
```

**WARNING:** This approach is not recommended for accessing sensitive files in applications using authentication through request headers (for example JWT). In the case of links/anchors, the headers are not handed over to the server which causes losing authentication and authorization processes.

**NOTE** Keep in mind that URL query has a limited size depending on your server configuration. We do not recommend to send big amount of data via action like long texts or templates used for file rendering.

### Handler implementation
Once the URL is formatted, you need to expose the file in the HTTP response. If you implement your handler like the following example, the mediator will detect that and won't write its own JSON response.
```
public class MyFileDownloadActionHandler : IMessageHandler<MyFileDownloadAction>
{
    private readonly IHttpContextAccessor _httpContextAccessor;
    public MyFileDownloadActionHandler(IHttpContextAccessor httpContextAccessor)
    {
        _httpContextAccessor = httpContextAccessor;
    }

    public async Task Handle(MyFileDownloadAction action, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        var httpContext = _httpContextAccessor.HttpContext;
        if (httpContext == null)
        {
            throw new InvalidOperationException($"Action {nameof(MyFileDownloadAction)} can be used only for request over HTTP.");
        }
        httpContext.Response.StatusCode = 200;
        httpContext.Response.ContentType = "text/plain";
        //Without this header, the file download does not pop up in the browser.
        httpContext.Response.Headers["Content-Disposition"] = $"attachment;filename={action.FileName}.txt";
        await httpContext.Response.WriteAsync("Hello world!", cancellationToken);
    }
}
```
