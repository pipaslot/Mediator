# 7. Custom action and handler types

Don't you like naming as Request and Message? Or do you want to provide more action types to cover your specific pipeline behavior? Just define your own Action types.
Here is an example of naming for CQRS (Command and Query Responsibility Segregation)

ICommand.cs
```
using Pipaslot.Mediator.Abstractions;

namespace CustomMediator.Cqrs
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Marker type for actions and pipelines
    /// </summary>
    public interface ICommand :  : IMediatorAction
    {
    }
}
```

ICommandHandler.cs
```
using Pipaslot.Mediator.Abstractions;

namespace CustomMediator.Cqrs
{
    public interface ICommandHandler<TCommand> : IMediatorHandler<TCommand> where TCommand : ICommand
    {

    }
}
```

IQuery.cs
```
using Pipaslot.Mediator.Abstractions;

namespace CustomMediator.Cqrs
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Base interface for actions
    /// </summary>
    public interface IQuery<TResult> : IQuery, IMediatorAction<TResult>
    {
    }
    /// <summary>
    /// Marker type for pipelines
    /// </summary>
    public interface IQuery : IMediatorAction
    {
    }
}
```

IQueryHandler.cs
```
using Pipaslot.Mediator.Abstractions;

namespace CustomMediator.Cqrs
{
    public interface IQueryHandler<TQuery, TResult> : IMediatorHandler<TQuery, TResult> where TQuery: IQuery<TResult>
    {

    }
}

```

And that is it. Easy!

Now you just create inherited actions and handlers to meet your business needs. And don't forget to use Pipelines to boost your solution.
