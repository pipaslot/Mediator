# 4. Configuration for In process usage

Before the mediator executes an action via a handler, the action is propagated through a pipeline as is shown in the following diagram. 
![Use of mediator in-process](../img/mediator-in-process.png)

The minimal registration for the mediator is through the extension method on Service Collection:
``` 
services.AddMediator();
```
After this initialization, dependency injection will serve you the interface `IMediator` described in previous chapters.
But the mediator does not know about handlers at the moment so he wouldn't be able to execute the action. You must tell him where to have look for them. You do not have to register every handler one by one. It is enough to just tell the mediator in which assembly they are defined.
``` 
services.AddMediator()
    .AddHandlersFromAssembly(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly());
```
or you can specify the assembly by existing handler seed.
``` 
services.AddMediator()
    .AddHandlersFromAssemblyOf<MyActionHandler>();
```
## HandlerExistenceChecker service
Sometimes it may happen, that you forget to code a handler for your action, or accidentally create a second handler for the same action. This could cause issues during runtime.
Mediator contains service which checks that every action has at least one handler and at most amount supported by ExecutionMiddleware in the pipeline.
You can run the following code as an automated test or during startup in development mode.
```
var handlerExistenceChecker = services.GetService<Pipaslot.Mediator.Services.HandlerExistenceChecker>();
handlerExistenceChecker.Verify();
```
but HandlerExistence checked do not know by default where to search for actions to be verified. You have to specify assemblies where the actions are defined via mediator configuration on service collection. The registration work the same as for handlers. You can specify assembly: 
``` 
services.AddMediator()
    .AddActionsFromAssembly(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly());
```
or you can specify the assembly by existing action seed.
``` 
services.AddMediator()
    .AddActionsFromAssemblyOf<MyAction>();
```

## Pipelines
Pipelines represent a set of mediator middlewares wrapping handler execution. The principle of mediator middlewares is very similar to ASP.NET Core middlewares in the application request pipeline.

They are useful in cases when you want to apply different pre-processing or post-processing for handler execution:

_For example, you want to apply caching for Request responses which should not affect messages. On the opposite side, you want to audit all messages sent through a mediator but do not want to audit Requests._

Pipelines are optional. You can define multiple pipelines for different action types, but only one pipeline will be always used.
Even if you do not specify any pipeline, a default pipeline with single handler execution middleware will be applied in the background.

Pipelines are chosen by marker interfaces implemented by the action classes like `IRequest` or `IMessage`. The action marker interfaces do not specify the generic return type, even if the action should return any data. They are intended to be used only in the pipeline configuration.
You should not use in actions multiple or shared marker types. If the action marker type would be used in multiple pipelines (for example via inheritance), the first matching pipeline would be used only.

For better understanding here is a code snippet that describes IRequest<TResult>, its marker interface, and pipeline specification:
```
// Request action describing expected response as generic type.
// Implements IRequest marker interface and top level action definition specifying that this action returns result
public interface IRequest<out TResponse> : IRequest, IMediatorAction<TResponse>{
}

// Request marker interface implementing top level action marker type
public interface IRequest : IMediatorAction    {
}

// Our custom action
public class MyAction : IRequest<MyActionResult>{
    // ... parameters
}
```
and the pipeline configuration will be:
```
services.AddMediator()
    .AddPipeline<IRequest>()
    // ... middleware registration 
```

In fact, the handlers are not executed by the mediator itself, but by specific middlewares (implementing interface `IExecutionMiddleware`) which is at the end of every pipeline.
You do not have to worry if you would forget to specify execution middleware in your pipeline. Mediator always adds default execution middleware if missing.


### Pipeline types
You can register two types of pipelines. Action specific and default. 

#### Action specific pipeline
Action-specific pipelines use action markers interfaces and they have higher priority when resolving pipelines in comparison with default pipelines. 
``` 
services.AddMediator()
    .AddPipeline<IMessage>()
        .Use<...>()           // Specify middlewares
    .AddPipeline<IRequest>()
        .Use<...>()           // Specify middlewares
```
The first pipeline will be used if executed action implements IMessage marker interface.
The second pipeline will be used if executed action implements IRequest marker interface.

In case you need a better-specified condition to decide which pipeline is suitable, you can use the overload accepting function Func<Type,bool>. 
```
.AddPipeline<IMessage>()
// Equals to
.AddPipeline(typeof(IMessage).ToString(), actionType => typeof(IMessage).IsAssignableFrom(actionType));
```
_This overload is available since v4.1.0_

#### Default pipeline
Default pipeline is used as a fallback in case there is no action-specific pipeline matching executed action.
``` 
services.AddMediator()
    .AddDefaultPipeline()
        .Use<...>()        // Specify middlewares
```

### Pipeline override
Every pipeline definition can exist only once. If you register the same pipeline multiple times, the previous pipeline definition will be removed. This behavior is intended for cases where you are building a library with some default pipelines but you want to provide an option to override the existing pipelines.
``` 
services.AddMediator()
    .AddPipeline<IMessage>() // **To be ignored**
        .Use<...>()          // Specify middlewares
    .AddPipeline<IMessage>() // **To be used**
        .Use<...>()          // Specify middlewares
    .AddDefaultPipeline()    // **To be ignored**
        .Use<...>()          // Specify middlewares
    .AddDefaultPipeline()    // **To be used**
        .Use<...>()          // Specify middlewares
```
